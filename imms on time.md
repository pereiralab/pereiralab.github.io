A new initiative in Perth is using digital technology to address the persistent challenge of childhood vaccination coverage. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, immunisation rates in Perth have dropped to 89.7% by age two, falling short of the national benchmark of 95%. While Aboriginal families in the region already benefit from a comprehensive vaccination support programme—including regular phone calls, appointment bookings, transport assistance, and home visits—the same level of support cannot be extended to the much larger non-Aboriginal population due to resource constraints. As a result, many children remain unprotected, not because of vaccine hesitancy, but due to practical barriers such as access, awareness, and logistical difficulties.

To tackle this, a team led by Professor Gavin Pereira, Dr Ben Scalley, and Dr Anastasia Phillips has developed a data-driven solution funded by the Western Australian Department of Health’s Future Health Research and Innovation Fund. The project employs machine learning to analyse linked health and demographic data, identifying children most at risk of missing their vaccinations. Families identified by the system are prioritised for targeted support, which includes reminders, help with bookings, transport, and home visits. This approach builds on Curtin’s expertise in predictive modelling and the Metropolitan Centre for Disease Control’s experience in running successful vaccination programmes for Aboriginal families.

The technical backbone of the project is the integration of data from the Child Development Information System and the Australian Immunisation Register. Predictive factors such as maternal age, language spoken at home, socioeconomic status, and previous vaccination history are analysed to ensure the system is both fair and comprehensive, covering all births in metropolitan Perth since 2018. The effectiveness of the programme will be evaluated by comparing vaccination rates before and after families receive support.

Community involvement is central to the project’s design and delivery. Consumer representatives—parents of young children—are actively engaged in shaping the programme and providing ongoing feedback. The project team brings together public health physicians, epidemiologists, data scientists, and consumer advocates, ensuring a blend of technical, clinical, and lived experience.

The anticipated impact is significant. By ensuring more children are vaccinated on time, the risk of outbreaks is reduced and vulnerable groups are better protected. The model is designed to be scalable, with potential for adoption across Australia and internationally in regions facing similar challenges. Ultimately, the project aims to reduce health inequities and ensure that all children, regardless of background, have the best possible start in life.

Western Australia is no stranger to the harsh realities of climate change—scorching heatwaves, thick bushfire smoke, and swirling red dust are part of life for many. But what if these environmental stressors are doing more than just making people uncomfortable? A new research collaboration between Curtin University and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health is set to uncover how these climate extremes might be quietly shaping the mental health of entire communities.
The project starts with a simple but powerful idea: while climate stressors don’t directly cause mental illness, they can act as triggers or amplifiers for those already at risk. Imagine a hot night that disrupts sleep, or a smoky day that keeps people indoors and away from support networks. For someone living with a mental health condition, these disruptions can tip the balance, leading to acute episodes or even hospitalisation. And because almost everyone is exposed to these environmental factors, the ripple effect across the population could be huge.
To get to the heart of the issue, the research team will blend hard data with lived experience. They’ll use hospital records and advanced climate modelling to track how daily exposures to heat, smoke, and dust line up with spikes in mental health hospitalisations. The analysis will dig into the economic costs as well, putting a price tag on the burden that climate-driven mental health crises place on the health system.
But numbers only tell part of the story. That’s why the project is bringing in Aboriginal community representatives from Kalgoorlie right from the start. Their insights will help shape the research, ensuring it reflects real-world experiences and respects cultural perspectives. The goal is to build a foundation for a national study that’s both scientifically rigorous and grounded in community needs.
This partnership is more than a one-off project. By linking up Curtin’s expertise in environmental health with Harvard’s global leadership in climate-mental health research, the team hopes to spark a long-term exchange of ideas and skills. Early-career researchers from both sides of the globe will connect through seminars and workshops, building a new generation of experts ready to tackle the mental health impacts of a changing climate.
If all goes to plan, the findings will feed into a national research grant, setting the stage for a multi-year investigation. Even if funding hurdles arise, the team is committed to pushing forward, using preliminary results to keep momentum alive.
In a world where climate change is often discussed in terms of rising seas and melting ice, this project is a reminder that the most profound impacts might be felt much closer to home—in the minds and lives of ordinary people.

*Why does this matter now?*
Recent global research, including the Connecting Climate Minds agenda, highlights that climate change is not just an environmental or economic issue—it’s a mental health issue too. Extreme weather, food and water insecurity, forced migration, and the psychological toll of living with climate uncertainty are all contributing to rising levels of anxiety, depression, and trauma worldwide. Vulnerable groups, including young people, Indigenous communities, and those already living with mental health challenges, are at particular risk.
The agenda calls for research that is not only scientifically robust but also inclusive and community-led. It emphasises the need for transdisciplinary approaches, combining medical, social, cultural, and environmental expertise. Importantly, it recognises that solutions must be tailored to local contexts and informed by those with lived experience.

*What’s next for research and action?*
* Building better data and methods to understand the links between climate and mental health.
* Developing interventions that work before, during, and after climate events.
* Ensuring that mental health is integrated into climate policy and disaster planning.
* Supporting community leadership and Indigenous knowledge in both research and response.
* Raising awareness among policymakers, practitioners, and the public about the mental health impacts of climate change.

The message is clear: protecting mental health must be part of how we respond to climate change. By listening to communities, investing in research, and acting on what we learn, we can build resilience—not just for our environment, but for our minds as well.
